# Porfolio with 3D avatar

I thought of this portfolio as a very simple yet creative page. I've tried to pay attention to small details.

The 3D avatar was created with avaturn.me

The fully frontend website is made with React (with ViteJS) + ThreeJS, pure css.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
